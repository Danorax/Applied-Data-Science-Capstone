# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
IBM Data Science Specialization Course 10 of 10

You will take on the role of a data scientist working for a startup that intends to compete with SpaceX and in the process, follow the methodology of data science which involves data collection, data wrangling, analysis data exploration, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting. its results to interested parties.

It is tasked with predicting whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, costing $62 million; other providers cost more than $165 million each, much of the savings due to SpaceX being able to reuse the first stage.

Therefore, if you can accurately predict the probability that the first stage rocket will land successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your data science findings and models, the competing startup that hired you can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This course is the capstone course for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. You are expected to have completed all previous courses in the specialization/certificate before starting this one, as it requires the application of the knowledge and skills taught in those courses. In this course, there will not be too much new learning and instead the focus will be on practical work to demonstrate what you have learned in previous courses.
